## Week 11

### Progress Report
#### Build Overall Progress:
	My project, the raspberry Pi Rover, is well progressing. As I continue to build the rover I clearly see the bugs, the difficulties and the future updates/designs I would like to implement into the project. With my testing on the RaspiRover I am able to now implement the wireless part of the Rover by including my Battery pack and using a VNC connection to control the rover. In the future I plan to have it fully mobile and possibly include two more wheels into the build for a much more easy maneuvering system. 
#### Bugs and Difficulties:
	The most difficult part of this project was to implement the sensors. Although I believed the wiring was well done I felt as if the sensors were not as accurate enough to be tested properly on my rover. Sensors used: Elegoo HC-SR04 Ultrasonic. These sensors are used to calculate how far objects are. But as I tested these sensors it would either give me random detected objects or just not function at all. Another problem I have encountered was using the wrong voltage for a micro servo motor which caused it to burn out the motor and this was fixed by switching from 5V to 3.3V input.
#### Budget Report:
	With all my parts purchased and working correctly, my final budget report has been properly calculated and I have not spent more than my intended budget. 
#### Plans for the Future:
	With my Rover almost fully built and functional, I plan to implement a software app into the project which I have been working on in Android Studios. This app will allow me to fully control the RaspiRover and will also allow me to receive the Sensors correct measurements.
